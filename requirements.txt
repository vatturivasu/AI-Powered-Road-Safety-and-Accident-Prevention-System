# Use headless OpenCV for server environments. If OpenCV import fails on the cloud, use the safe option:
opencv-python-headless==4.7.0.72

# Optional (enable only if you want YOLO inference on cloud and have compatible torch):
# ultralytics
# torch~=2.2.0  # pin a version compatible with ultralytics and the cloud runner
